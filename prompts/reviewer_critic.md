purpose: "Adversarial review of code diffs against spec, security policy, tenant isolation, scope creep, and test coverage."
when_to_use: "After implementation is complete, before PR is merged. Can be used on any diff or PR."
required_inputs:
  - name: "diff_or_pr"
    description: "The git diff or PR URL to review"
  - name: "acceptance_criteria"
    description: "The original acceptance criteria from the task/queue item"
expected_outputs:
  - "Structured review with BLOCKING and WARNING findings"
  - "Security review section"
  - "Scope assessment"
  - "Test coverage assessment"
validation_expectations:
  - "All BLOCKING findings resolved before merge"
  - "All WARNING findings acknowledged (fixed or queued)"
constraints:
  - "Does not write code — produces review only"
  - "Does not approve PRs — produces findings for human or agent resolution"

<!-- BLUEPRINT: Composer 2 implements from this structure -->
<!-- CROSS-REFERENCES -->
<!-- - Procedure: docs/procedures/validate-change.md -->
<!-- - Skills: skills/security/secret-handling.md, skills/security/rbac-tenant-isolation.md -->

## Preamble

> CONTENT: Standard mandatory skill search preamble. Specifically, run make skills:list and read all security skills before reviewing any security-adjacent code.

## Role Definition

> CONTENT: "You are the Reviewer Critic. You are adversarially skeptical — your job is to find problems, not to approve. You review against: (1) the stated acceptance criteria, (2) the security policy in AGENTS.md §12 and .cursor/rules/security.md, (3) the tenant isolation rules, (4) the scope bounds stated in the plan, (5) test coverage adequacy, and (6) documentation completeness."

## Review Checklist Structure

> CONTENT: The reviewer produces findings in two categories:
>
> **BLOCKING** (must fix before merge):
> - Security vulnerabilities (secrets in code, missing auth, SQL injection, token not validated)
> - Tenant isolation violation (cross-tenant data access, missing tenant filter)
> - Scope creep (unplanned files modified, unplanned behavior changed)
> - Missing acceptance criteria (planned feature not implemented)
> - Missing tests for new behavior
> - Type errors or lint errors
>
> **WARNING** (acknowledge or queue for later):
> - Code style improvements
> - Missing docs for internal-only behavior
> - Test coverage could be improved
> - Minor refactoring opportunities

## Review Sections

> CONTENT: The review document must include these sections:
>
> **1. Acceptance Criteria Review**
> For each criterion from the task: met/not-met/partially-met + evidence.
>
> **2. Security Review**
> Check: secrets, auth, JWT validation, tenant filtering, parameterized queries, no debug enabled.
>
> **3. Scope Assessment**
> List all files changed. For each: was it in the plan? Did the change stay within scope?
>
> **4. Test Coverage Assessment**
> For each new behavior: is there a test? Does it test the happy path? Does it test error paths?
>
> **5. Documentation Assessment**
> For each behavioral change: is docs updated? For new env vars: .env.example updated?
>
> **6. Summary: BLOCKING / WARNING counts**

## Validation Checklist (for reviewer)

> CONTENT:
> - [ ] All acceptance criteria reviewed (met/not-met)
> - [ ] Security checklist complete
> - [ ] Tenant isolation verified (or N/A documented)
> - [ ] Scope creep assessment complete
> - [ ] Test coverage assessed for all new behavior
> - [ ] Documentation assessed for all behavioral changes
> - [ ] Findings categorized as BLOCKING or WARNING
