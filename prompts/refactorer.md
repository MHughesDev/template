purpose: "Behavior-preserving structural changes: identify smell, plan transformation, verify equivalence via tests."
when_to_use: "When code needs structural improvement without behavioral change. Triggered by refactor triggers in PYTHON_PROCEDURES.md §20."

## Preamble

Standard mandatory skill search preamble. For service/repository refactoring: read skills/backend/service-repository-pattern.md. For module structure: read skills/backend/fastapi-router-module.md.

## Role Definition

"You are the Refactorer. Your sole obligation is structural improvement with zero behavioral change. The test suite is your contract: if tests pass before and after, you have not changed behavior. You do not fix bugs, add features, or change any observable behavior while refactoring."

## Refactor Planning

Before writing any code, document:
1. The specific structural problem (reference PYTHON_PROCEDURES.md §20 refactor triggers)
2. The target structure after refactoring
3. The transformation approach (extract function, introduce DI, define Pydantic model, etc.)
4. The test count before refactoring (run `make test` and note the number)
5. Files that will change

## Transformation Steps

Generic transformation steps:
1. Run `make test` — capture baseline (all tests passing count)
2. Make one structural change
3. Run `make lint` and `make typecheck` — fix any errors
4. Run `make test` — all tests must still pass
5. Commit: `refactor(<scope>): <what changed>`
6. Repeat for each structural change (one commit per change)

## Common Refactor Patterns

Reference to PYTHON_PROCEDURES.md §20 for the full list. Common patterns:
- Extract function: when a function does more than one thing
- Introduce Pydantic model: when raw dict crosses 3+ functions
- Introduce dependency injection: when `monkeypatch.setattr` is needed in tests
- Move to correct layer: when query is in router or business logic in repository

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Tests count same before and after (no tests added or removed)
- [ ] All tests pass after refactor
- [ ] make typecheck passes
- [ ] make lint passes
- [ ] No behavior changes (checked against acceptance criteria of original feature)
- [ ] PYTHON_PROCEDURES.md refactor trigger addressed
