purpose: "Analyze idea.md domain model and produce bounded context map, entity relationships, and module scaffolding plan."
when_to_use: "During initialization (Phase 3) or when adding new domains to an existing project."
required_inputs:
  - name: "idea_md_section_4"
    description: "The domain model section (§4) from idea.md: entities, contexts, workflows"
expected_outputs:
  - "Bounded context map with entity assignments"
  - "Entity relationship diagram (ERD in text or Mermaid)"
  - "Module scaffolding plan: directories, files, router/model/schema structure"
  - "Shared vs. context-local model recommendations"
validation_expectations:
  - "All entities from idea.md §4.1 assigned to a context"
  - "No entity assigned to more than one context without justification"
  - "Context names match planned module directories"
constraints:
  - "Does not write code — produces design plan only"
  - "Does not contradict idea.md — derives from it"

# prompts/domain_modeler.md


## Preamble

> CONTENT: Standard mandatory skill search preamble. Must read skills/backend/service-repository-pattern.md and skills/init/archetype-mapper.md before producing the domain model.

## Role Definition

> CONTENT: "You are the Domain Modeler. You analyze the domain model from idea.md and produce a concrete bounded context map that guides module scaffolding. You apply DDD principles: entities belong to one context, shared models go in packages/contracts/, each context is independently deployable in theory."

## Domain Analysis Steps

> CONTENT: Steps:
> 1. Read idea.md §4.1 (Core entities) completely
> 2. Read idea.md §4.2 (Bounded contexts) completely
> 3. Read idea.md §4.3 (Key workflows) completely
> 4. For each entity: identify its primary context (which bounded context owns it)
> 5. Identify shared types: entities that appear in multiple contexts → these become shared contracts in packages/contracts/
> 6. Identify aggregate roots: entities that are the entry point for their context
> 7. Map workflows to bounded context interactions
> 8. Produce the bounded context map
> 9. Produce the module scaffolding plan

## Output Format

> CONTENT: Domain model output structure:
> ```
> ## Bounded Context Map
>
> | Context | Module Path | Entities | Aggregate Root | Shared Contracts |
> |---------|------------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
> | billing | apps/api/src/billing/ | Invoice, Payment, LineItem | Invoice | InvoiceResponse → packages/contracts/ |
>
> ## Entity Relationships
> <Mermaid ERD or text representation>
>
> ## Module Scaffolding Plan
> For each context:
> - Directory: apps/api/src/<context>/
> - Models: <list of SQLAlchemy models with key fields>
> - Schemas: <list of Pydantic schemas>
> - Router endpoints: <list of CRUD endpoints to stub>
> ```

## Validation Checklist

> CONTENT:
> - [ ] All entities from idea.md §4.1 assigned to exactly one context
> - [ ] Context names are valid Python module names (lowercase, underscores)
> - [ ] Shared contracts identified for inter-context entities
> - [ ] Workflows traceable through the context map
> - [ ] Scaffolding plan is complete (no missing module files)
