# .cursor/rules/queue.md

Invariants for **`queue/queue.csv`** and **`queue/queuearchive.csv`**. Canonical SOP: **`queue/QUEUE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**. Validate with **`make queue:validate`**.

## Schema

1. **`queue.csv`** header (order): **`id,batch,phase,category,summary,dependencies,notes,created_date`** (adjust only if **`queue-validate`** and docs agree).
2. **`queuearchive.csv`** includes the same columns **plus** **`status`** and **`completed_date`**.
3. **`id`**: unique; prefer stable IDs such as **`Q-001`**.
4. **`category`**: must match **`docs/queue/queue-categories.md`**.
5. **`summary`**: long enough to be a **contract** (goal, acceptance criteria, done definition) — typically **≥ 100 characters** when enforced by tooling.
6. **`dependencies`**: comma-separated queue **`id`** values or empty.
7. **`notes`**: blockers, PR URLs, completion metadata — never delete history casually.

## Lifecycle

1. Active work is represented by the **top data row** in **`queue.csv`** for single-lane operation (see SOP).
2. **Blocked** rows stay in **`queue.csv`** with explicit **`notes`**.
3. **Done / cancelled / superseded** rows move to **`queuearchive.csv`** with **`status`** and dates — **append-only** archive.
4. Never **delete** a row without an archived copy when the lifecycle requires retention.

## Branches and PRs

1. Queue work branches: **`queue/<id>-short-slug`** including the **`id`**.
2. PR title/body references the queue **`id`** and links to the row when possible.

## Summary quality

Agents treat **`summary`** as the contract. If it is ambiguous, **stop** and ask for clarification rather than guessing.
