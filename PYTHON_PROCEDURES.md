## 1. Boundary-First Design

**Rule:** Define Pydantic schemas before writing any logic. Validate at the edge (ingress/egress). Never pass raw external payloads deep into the system.

**Procedure:**

1. Identify the boundary (HTTP request, queue message, external API response, file upload, env var).
2. Define a Pydantic model for every external payload **before** writing any handler or service function.
3. In the router or adapter, parse the incoming data with `Model.model_validate(raw_data)` immediately — if it fails, raise `422` or equivalent before any logic runs.
4. Pass the **validated model object** (not `dict`, not raw JSON) to service functions.
5. At egress, define a response schema and use `Model.model_validate(result)` before returning.
6. Never allow raw `dict` or `Any` to travel through service or repository layers.

**Rationale:** Boundary validation makes the system's trust boundary explicit and auditable. Internal code can assume data is well-typed.

---

## 2. Typed Signatures

**Rule:** Every non-trivial public function must have fully typed parameters, return type, and documented error expectations. No `Any` without a documented reason. Run `mypy --strict`.

**Procedure:**

1. Every public function signature: `def fn(param: Type, ...) -> ReturnType:`.
2. For async: `async def fn(param: Type) -> ReturnType:`.
3. For functions that may raise, document in docstring: `Raises: ExceptionType — when condition`.
4. `Any` is only acceptable when wrapping truly dynamic data (e.g., JSON deserialization before schema validation). Add `# type: ignore[assignment]  # reason` with explicit reason.
5. Use `TypeVar` and `Generic` for reusable typed containers.
6. Maintain a `py.typed` marker in all packages to enable mypy type checking for consumers.
7. CI runs `mypy --strict` on every PR — no new `type: ignore` without code review approval.

**Enforcement:** `pyproject.toml` `[tool.mypy]` with `strict = true`.

---

## 3. Shape Declaration and Serialization

**Rule:** Use Pydantic models or TypedDict for every cross-module data shape. Named contracts, not anonymous dicts. Normalize dates, enums, and decimals consistently.

**Procedure:**

1. Every data shape crossing a module boundary gets a Pydantic `BaseModel` (or `TypedDict` for simple structures not needing validation).
2. All datetime fields use `datetime` type with timezone awareness; normalize to UTC at ingress.
3. All enum fields use Python `Enum`; never raw strings for categorical values.
4. All decimal/money fields use `Decimal`, not `float`.
5. Serialization: use `model.model_dump(mode="json")` for JSON output; never `dict(model)` or `vars(model)`.
6. Cross-service contracts live in `packages/contracts/` — not in individual apps.
7. Version the contract when backward-incompatible changes are needed (see `packages/contracts/AGENTS.md`).

---

## 4. Interface and Dependency Injection

**Rule:** Prefer `Protocol` over `ABC`. Code against the interface, inject implementations via FastAPI `Depends()` or constructors. Test against the interface, not the implementation.

**Procedure:**

1. Define service interfaces as `Protocol` classes in the module's `interfaces.py` or in `packages/contracts/`.
2. Concrete implementations live in separate files (e.g., `repository.py`, `service.py`).
3. In FastAPI routes, inject via `Depends(get_service_factory)` — never instantiate services directly in route handlers.
4. For non-FastAPI code (scripts, machinery), inject via constructor: `class Service: def __init__(self, repo: RepositoryProtocol): ...`.
5. In tests, create a mock/fake that implements the same `Protocol` — do not patch internals.
6. Never use global mutable state for service instances; use DI container or factory functions.

---

## 5. Validation at the Edge

**Rule:** Validate and normalize once at the boundary. Inside the system, trust typed objects. Validate at egress if correctness of output matters.

**Procedure:**

1. **Ingress** (HTTP, message queue, file): parse → validate → normalize in the adapter/router. Produce trusted typed objects.
2. **Internal**: never re-validate what was already validated at ingress. Trust the type.
3. **Egress** (HTTP response, external API call, queue publish): if output correctness is critical, validate the output schema before sending.
4. Validation failures at ingress raise `ValidationError` (Pydantic) caught by the global error handler → `422 Unprocessable Entity`.
5. Never validate in service layer unless the data originated from a different trust boundary (e.g., reading from DB and re-exposing externally).

---

## 6. Domain Separation

**Rule:** Thin routes (orchestrate only). Business rules in services. Persistence in repositories. Framework code at edges.

**Layers (strict top-down, no skipping):**

```
Router (transport layer)
  → calls Service (domain/business rules)
    → calls Repository (persistence/data access)
      → calls Database (SQLAlchemy session)
```

**Procedure:**

1. **Router functions** (`router.py`): receive request, call service, return response. No business logic. No direct DB access.
2. **Service functions** (`service.py`): contain business rules, orchestration, state transitions. Call repositories. Raise domain exceptions. Manage transaction boundaries.
3. **Repository functions** (`repository.py` or in `service.py` for simple cases): build and execute DB queries. Return domain objects (SQLAlchemy models or Pydantic models). No business logic.
4. **Middleware** (`middleware.py`): cross-cutting concerns (auth, tenant context, logging, correlation IDs). No business logic.
5. **Domain exceptions** (`exceptions.py`): raised by services, caught by routers and translated to HTTP responses.

---

## 7. Import Direction and Module Structure

**Rule:** `router → service → repository`. Never reverse. Shared types in `schemas.py` or `packages/contracts/`. Circular imports are a structural error.

**Canonical module layout:**

```
apps/api/src/<context>/
├── __init__.py          # public API exports (router, key types)
├── router.py            # FastAPI router and endpoint handlers
├── models.py            # SQLAlchemy models
├── schemas.py           # Pydantic request/response schemas
├── service.py           # business logic
├── dependencies.py      # FastAPI Depends() factories
└── (repository.py)      # optional: separate if persistence is complex
```

**Import rules:**

- `router.py` imports from: `schemas.py`, `service.py`, `dependencies.py`
- `service.py` imports from: `models.py`, `schemas.py` (or `packages/contracts/`), `exceptions.py`
- `repository.py` imports from: `models.py`, `apps/api/src/database.py`
- `schemas.py` imports from: `packages/contracts/` only — never from routers/services
- **Forbidden:** `service.py` importing from `router.py`; `models.py` importing from `service.py`
- Circular imports are a signal of wrong layer assignment — fix the structure, not the import

---

## 8. Explicit State

**Rule:** Use `Enum` or `Literal` for states. Use `dict[State, set[State]]` for transition maps. A `transition()` function enforces the map. Apply to: queue lifecycle, order status, jobs, approvals.

**Procedure:**

1. Define states as a Python `Enum`:
   ```python
   class OrderStatus(str, Enum):
       PENDING = "pending"
       CONFIRMED = "confirmed"
       CANCELLED = "cancelled"
   ```
2. Define allowed transitions as a mapping:
   ```python
   TRANSITIONS: dict[OrderStatus, set[OrderStatus]] = {
       OrderStatus.PENDING: {OrderStatus.CONFIRMED, OrderStatus.CANCELLED},
       OrderStatus.CONFIRMED: {OrderStatus.CANCELLED},
       OrderStatus.CANCELLED: set(),
   }
   ```
3. Implement a `transition(current: State, target: State) -> State` function that validates against the map and raises `InvalidTransitionError` if disallowed.
4. Never mutate state by setting a field directly without calling `transition()`.
5. State enum values in DB are stored as strings (use `sa.Enum` or `sa.String` with enum validation).

---

## 9. Error Policy

**Rule:** Custom exception hierarchy in `exceptions.py`. Base exception carries `code`, `status`, and `message`. Catch at the correct layer. Translate infrastructure errors at adapter boundaries. Never swallow exceptions silently. Log context without secrets.

**Exception hierarchy:**

```python
# apps/api/src/exceptions.py
class AppError(Exception):
    code: str
    status_code: int
    message: str

class NotFoundError(AppError): ...
class ValidationError(AppError): ...
class AuthenticationError(AppError): ...
class AuthorizationError(AppError): ...
class ConflictError(AppError): ...
class ExternalServiceError(AppError): ...
```

**Procedure:**

1. Define all custom exceptions in `apps/api/src/exceptions.py` with `code`, `status_code`, `message`.
2. Services raise domain exceptions (`NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, etc.) — never HTTP exceptions directly.
3. Routers catch domain exceptions and translate to `HTTPException` (or let the global handler do it).
4. Global exception handler in `middleware.py` catches `AppError` subclasses and returns structured JSON error response.
5. Repository layer catches `SQLAlchemyError` and re-raises as `ExternalServiceError` or specific domain exceptions.
6. **Never:** `except Exception: pass` or logging an exception without re-raising or handling.
7. Log the exception with context: `logger.error("...", exc_info=True, extra={"correlation_id": ..., "user_id": ...})` — never log secrets, tokens, or passwords.

---

## 10. Configuration

**Rule:** Single Pydantic `BaseSettings` in `config.py`. Validate on startup. No `os.getenv()` anywhere except `config.py`. Pass config via dependency injection.

**Procedure:**

1. One `Settings(BaseSettings)` class in `apps/api/src/config.py`.
2. All env vars declared as fields with type annotations, defaults, and descriptions.
3. `@field_validator` for cross-field validation (e.g., database URL format).
4. Instantiate as a module-level singleton: `settings = Settings()` (fails fast on startup if invalid).
5. Expose via FastAPI `Depends(get_settings)` for use in routes.
6. **Forbidden:** `os.getenv("VAR")` anywhere except `config.py`. This makes it impossible to audit which env vars the app reads.
7. `.env.example` documents every var; `scripts/env-var-sync.py` verifies sync.

---

## 11. Async

**Rule:** Route handlers are `async` by default. All I/O uses async libraries. CPU-bound work offloaded via `asyncio.to_thread` or background tasks. Never block the event loop. Use `asyncio.gather` for concurrent independent I/O.

**Procedure:**

1. All FastAPI route handlers: `async def endpoint(...) -> ResponseModel:`.
2. Database operations: use `AsyncSession` from SQLAlchemy async extension.
3. HTTP calls to external services: use `httpx.AsyncClient`, not `requests`.
4. File I/O: use `aiofiles` for large files; `anyio` for other async I/O.
5. CPU-bound work: wrap in `asyncio.to_thread(cpu_bound_fn, args)`.
6. Multiple independent async operations: use `results = await asyncio.gather(op1(), op2())`.
7. **Never:** `time.sleep()` in async code — use `await asyncio.sleep()`.
8. **Never:** synchronous database drivers in async handlers (e.g., `psycopg2` directly — use `asyncpg`).

---

## 12. Nullability

**Rule:** Prefer non-optional types. Use `T | None` not `Optional[T]`. Never return `None` as an error signal. Narrow before use. `mypy --strict` catches unhandled `None`.

**Procedure:**

1. Prefer `str` over `str | None` wherever a value is always present.
2. When `None` is semantically valid (e.g., optional field), use `T | None` (Python 3.10+ union syntax).
3. Do not use `Optional[T]` (the `typing.Optional` form) — use `T | None` directly.
4. When a function might not find a value, return `T | None` and document when `None` is returned — never silently return `None` for errors.
5. Before using a nullable, narrow: `if value is None: raise NotFoundError(...)` or `if value is not None: use(value)`.
6. In Pydantic models, use `Field(default=None)` for optional fields — mypy will enforce that callers handle `None`.
7. **Never:** `value or default_value` when `value` could legitimately be falsy (e.g., `0`, `""`) — use `value if value is not None else default_value`.

---

## 13. Immutability by Default

**Rule:** `frozen=True` on boundary shapes, config, and domain events. Use tuples over lists for fixed collections. Use `Mapping`/`Sequence` in signatures. Make mutation deliberate and localized.

**Procedure:**

1. All Pydantic models representing external input/output: `model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True)`.
2. `Settings` class: `frozen=True` — configuration never changes at runtime.
3. Domain events: frozen dataclasses or frozen Pydantic models.
4. In function signatures, prefer `Sequence[T]` over `list[T]` and `Mapping[K, V]` over `dict[K, V]` when the function only reads.
5. When mutation is needed (e.g., building a response), use a mutable local variable and convert to immutable at boundary.
6. SQLAlchemy models are mutable (they represent DB state) — that is the expected exception.

---

## 14. Persistence

**Rule:** Queries in repository layer only. Return domain objects, not raw rows. Service owns transaction boundaries. No mixed query + business logic.

**Procedure:**

1. All SQLAlchemy queries live in repository functions (or in `service.py` if no dedicated repository).
2. Repository functions return: SQLAlchemy model instances, Pydantic models, or primitive types — never `Row` objects or raw dicts.
3. Services own `async with session.begin():` transaction boundaries.
4. Repository functions receive `AsyncSession` as a parameter (injected by the service or FastAPI `Depends`).
5. **Never:** query in router handlers or middleware.
6. **Never:** business logic (state transitions, validation, calculations) in repository functions.
7. For tenant-scoped models: always add `.where(Model.tenant_id == tenant_id)` — use `TenantMixin` to enforce this at the model level.

---

## 15. Testing

**Rule:** Unit test domain in isolation. Integration test boundaries. API test contracts. Regression test before fix. Test behavior not implementation. Use factories. Descriptive names.

**Procedure:**

1. **Unit tests** (`test_<module>.py`): test service/domain logic with mocked dependencies. No DB, no HTTP.
2. **Integration tests** (`test_<module>_integration.py`): test with real DB (SQLite in CI), real sessions, real migrations applied.
3. **API tests** (`test_<module>.py` using `httpx.AsyncClient`): test request → response contract. HTTP only — mock external services.
4. **Regression tests**: when a bug is reported, write the failing test first, then fix, then verify the test passes.
5. **Test naming:** `test_<unit_under_test>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>` e.g., `test_login_invalid_password_returns_401`.
6. **Factories:** use factory functions or `factory_boy` to create test data — never hardcode entity IDs.
7. **No shared mutable state** between tests — use fixtures with proper scope (function > module > session).
8. **Coverage floor:** defined in `docs/quality/coverage-policy.md`; enforced by `scripts/coverage-ratchet.py`.

---

## 16. Logging and Observability

**Rule:** Structured JSON logs. Correlation IDs. Log transitions and boundary events. Mask secrets. Appropriate log levels.

**Procedure:**

1. Use structured logging: `logger.info("event", extra={"key": value, ...})` with a JSON formatter in production.
2. Every request gets a `correlation_id` (UUID) injected by middleware and included in all log records for that request.
3. Log at boundaries: request received, service called with key inputs, response returned.
4. Log state transitions: `logger.info("order_status_changed", extra={"from": old, "to": new, "order_id": id})`.
5. **Never log:** passwords, JWT tokens, API keys, full credit card numbers, or any secret value.
6. Log levels:
   - `DEBUG`: detailed developer information (disabled in production)
   - `INFO`: normal operations, state transitions, significant events
   - `WARNING`: unexpected but handled conditions
   - `ERROR`: failures that affect a user or operation (with `exc_info=True`)
   - `CRITICAL`: system-level failures requiring immediate action
7. Metrics: increment counters for errors, latency histograms for external calls.

---

## 17. CI Enforcement

**Rule:** Formatter, linter, type checker, tests, security scan must all pass. Fail on any violation. No warnings-only. Every PR.

**CI pipeline checks (in order):**

1. `make fmt` — ruff format check (no auto-fix in CI, only check)
2. `make lint` — ruff lint (all rules in `pyproject.toml`)
3. `make typecheck` — mypy `--strict` on all source
4. `make test` — pytest with coverage; fail if below floor
5. `make security:scan` — bandit (SAST) + dependency audit
6. `make image:build` + `make image:scan` — Trivy on built image

**Enforcement rules:**

- No PR merges with failing CI.
- No `# noqa` or `# type: ignore` added without code review comment explaining why.
- Coverage floor only goes up (ratchet) — never decreases without approved exception.
- Security findings classified HIGH or CRITICAL block merge unless documented in `docs/security/accepted-risks.md`.

---

## 18. Code Review

**Rule:** Verify typed boundaries, correct layer assignment, explicit contracts, import direction, `None` handling, tests present. Reject shortcuts that increase ambiguity.

**Code review checklist for Python changes:**

- [ ] All public functions have typed signatures (params + return type)
- [ ] No raw `dict` crossing module boundaries — Pydantic models used
- [ ] Service/repository separation maintained — no queries in routers
- [ ] Import direction correct (`router → service → repository`, never reverse)
- [ ] All `None` values handled explicitly before use
- [ ] Exceptions raised are custom `AppError` subclasses, not generic `Exception`
- [ ] Configuration read from `Settings`, not `os.getenv()`
- [ ] Tests added for new behavior (unit + integration where appropriate)
- [ ] No secrets, credentials, or tokens in code or comments
- [ ] State transitions use the `transition()` function, not direct field assignment
- [ ] Async code uses async I/O — no blocking calls in async functions

**Rejection criteria:** Ambiguity-increasing shortcuts (e.g., `Any` without reason, `pass` in except blocks, magic strings instead of enums, hardcoded config values) are automatic rejection.

---

## 19. Condensed 12-Point Rule Set

Quick reference for agents. Full procedures above take precedence in case of conflict.

1. **Boundary shapes first** — Pydantic models before logic; validate at edge; no raw dicts deep in system
2. **Type every signature** — params, return type, errors; `mypy --strict`; no unexplained `Any`
3. **Named contracts** — Pydantic/TypedDict for cross-module data; normalize dates/enums/decimals
4. **Protocol + DI** — code against interface; inject via `Depends()` or constructor; test against interface
5. **Validate once at edge** — trust typed objects internally; validate egress if correctness matters
6. **Thin routes, fat services** — router orchestrates; service rules; repository persists; no cross-layer leakage
7. **One-way imports** — `router → service → repository`; circulars are structural errors; fix the structure
8. **Enums and transition maps** — `Enum` for states; `dict[State, set[State]]` for allowed transitions; enforce via `transition()`
9. **Custom errors, correct layer** — `exceptions.py` hierarchy; catch at correct layer; translate at adapter; never swallow
10. **Single config source** — `BaseSettings` in `config.py`; `os.getenv()` forbidden elsewhere; DI for access
11. **Async all the way** — async handlers; async I/O; `to_thread` for CPU; `gather` for concurrent ops
12. **Explicit nullability** — `T | None`; never `None` as error signal; narrow before use; strict mypy catches gaps

---

## 20. Refactor Triggers

Refactor when **any** of the following is true:

| Trigger | Signal | Recommended action |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| Intent no longer obvious | Must re-read 3+ times to understand a function | Extract, rename, add type hints |
| Function does more than one thing | "and" in the function name | Split into focused functions |
| Repeated pattern appears 3+ times | Copy-paste with minor variations | Extract shared utility |
| Service imports from another service | Cross-service direct dependency | Introduce shared contract or event |
| Raw dict passed through 3+ functions | Untyped data traveling far | Define Pydantic model at source |
| Circular import | Import error at runtime | Restructure modules, move shared types |
| Test requires patching internals | `monkeypatch.setattr` on internal function | Refactor to dependency injection |
| Config read in non-config location | `os.getenv()` outside `config.py` | Move to `Settings`, inject via DI |
| `except Exception: pass` | Silent failure | Handle explicitly or log + re-raise |
| State mutation without transition check | Direct field assignment | Add `transition()` guard |
| Function longer than ~50 lines | Complex control flow | Extract private helpers |
| Module larger than ~300 lines | Monolithic file | Split by concern into submodules |

**Refactor policy:** Refactoring is a first-class queue item — not something done silently alongside feature work. If refactor is needed to implement a feature cleanly, create a separate queue item for the refactor, do it first, then implement the feature.
