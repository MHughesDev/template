<!-- CROSS-REFERENCES -->

> PURPOSE: Ubiquitous language and domain glossary. Defines terms used consistently across spec, code, and documentation. Per spec §26.12 item 374.

## Purpose

> CONTENT: This glossary is the single source of truth for term definitions in this repository. Agents and humans use these definitions when writing code, docs, and specs. Ambiguous terms are resolved here, not ad hoc.

> | **Queue item** | A single row in queue.csv representing a unit of agent work | queue/queue.csv |
> | **Summary** | The elaborative description in queue item's summary column — the work contract | queue/queue.csv §summary |
