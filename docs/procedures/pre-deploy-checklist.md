# Pre-Deployment Checklist

## Purpose

Validate that all prerequisites are met before deploying to cloud infrastructure. This checklist prevents common deployment failures by catching issues early.

## When to Run

- Before first deployment to new environment
- Before every production deployment
- After infrastructure changes
- When onboarding new team members to deployment process

## How to Run

```bash
# Automated check
make pre-deploy-check ENV=staging

# Or manual review
# Go through each section and verify items
```

## Security Checklist

### Secrets Management

- [ ] **No secrets in Git**
  ```bash
  # Run secret scanner
  make secrets:scan
  # Should report: "No secrets found"
  ```

- [ ] **SECRET_KEY is unique per environment**
  - Not "changethis" or default value
  - Different values for staging vs. production
  - 64+ character random string
  ```bash
  # Verify in GitHub/GitLab environment
  # Should be: openssl rand -hex 32
  ```

- [ ] **Database password is complex**
  - 20+ characters
  - Mix of alphanumeric and symbols
  - Not "postgres" or "password"

- [ ] **First superuser password is complex**
  - Different from database password
  - Not stored in code or default configs

- [ ] **Sentry DSN uses correct environment**
  - Staging DSN for staging
  - Production DSN for production
  - Not the template example DSN

- [ ] **Email credentials secured**
  - SMTP password in secrets, not config
  - Test email disabled or configured correctly

### Infrastructure Security

- [ ] **Container runs as non-root**
  - Already in template: `runAsUser: 1000`
  - Verify: `kubectl exec -n prod deployment/api -- id`
  - Should show: `uid=1000` not `uid=0`

- [ ] **Read-only root filesystem (production)**
  - Optional hardening: `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
  - Temp directory mounted for writes if needed

- [ ] **Resource limits enforced**
  - CPU and memory limits set in deployment
  - Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

- [ ] **Network policies considered**
  - Database traffic restricted to app namespace
  - Ingress only on required ports (80, 443, 8000)

- [ ] **TLS 1.2+ only**
  - Let's Encrypt or custom certificates
  - HTTP redirects to HTTPS
  - No port 80 except for redirect

## Final Verification (Staging)

Before first production deployment, verify on staging:

### Functionality

- [ ] **User registration works**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/v1/users/signup \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass123","full_name":"Test"}'
  # Should return 200 with user object
  ```

- [ ] **Login returns valid JWT**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/v1/login/access-token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "username=test@example.com&password=testpass123"
  # Should return: {"access_token":"eyJ...","token_type":"bearer"}
  ```

- [ ] **Authenticated requests succeed**
  ```bash
  curl https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/v1/users/me \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
  # Should return current user object
  ```

- [ ] **Primary entity CRUD works**
  - Create resource
  - List resources  
  - Update resource
  - Delete resource

- [ ] **Password reset email sent** (if email enabled)
  - Request password reset
  - Verify email received in inbox
  - Reset link works

### Performance

- [ ] **Response time acceptable**
  ```bash
  # Most requests < 500ms p95
  curl -w "@curl-format.txt" https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/v1/utils/health-check/
  ```

- [ ] **Database queries optimized**
  - No N+1 queries
  - Indexes used for filtering
  - Slow query log reviewed

### Security

- [ ] **TLS certificate valid**
  ```bash
  openssl s_client -connect staging.yourdomain.com:443 -servername staging.yourdomain.com
  # Should show: Verification: OK
  ```

- [ ] **CORS headers correct**
  ```bash
  curl -I https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/v1/utils/health-check/ \
    -H "Origin: https://app.staging.yourdomain.com"
  # Should show: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.staging.yourdomain.com
  ```

---

## Quick Reference: One-Line Checks

```bash
# All checks in one command (after make target exists)
make pre-deploy-check ENV=staging

# Or individual checks:
make lint && make test                    # CI validation
docker pull ghcr.io/org/repo:latest       # Registry access
kubectl get nodes                         # Cluster health
dig api.yourdomain.com                    # DNS resolution
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"        # Database connection
kubectl get secret api-secrets -n prod   # Secrets exist
curl -f https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/utils/health-check/  # App health
```

## Sign-Off

Before deploying to production, obtain sign-off from:

| Role | Name | Date | Signature |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| Engineering Lead | | | |
| DevOps/SRE (if applicable) | | | |
| Product Owner (if major release) | | | |

**By signing, you confirm:**
- All checklist items verified
- Staging deployment tested
- Rollback plan understood
- Team ready to monitor post-deploy

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

After production deployment, run these checks:

- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] Error rate at baseline (check Sentry)
- [ ] Can register new user
- [ ] Can login and access authenticated endpoints
- [ ] Logs flowing without errors
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards green

---

## Troubleshooting Checklist Failures

### "Secrets in Git" failure
```bash
# Check what was found
truffleHog filesystem . --json

# If false positive, add to . trufflehogignore
# If real secret, rotate immediately
```

### "Database connection refused"
- Check firewall/security groups
- Verify credentials in secrets
- Confirm SSL mode (try `sslmode=require`)
- Check if database instance is running

### "DNS not resolving"
- Check A record points to correct IP
- Wait for propagation (up to 48 hours)
- Verify with multiple DNS servers
- Check domain hasn't expired

### "Health check failing"
- Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -n prod deployment/api`
- Verify database connectivity
- Check environment variables set correctly
- Ensure migrations applied
