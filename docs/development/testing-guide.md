**Purpose:** Pytest layout, markers, async tests, and coverage expectations for the API.

## Overview

Pytest layout, markers, async tests, and coverage expectations for the API. See [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for validation commands and [spec/spec.md](../../spec/spec.md) for the full specification.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make test` | Full suite with coverage (see `pyproject.toml` threshold) |
| `make test-unit` / `make test:unit` | `TEST_TYPE=unit` |
| `make test-integration` / `make test:integration` | Integration subset |
| `make test-smoke` / `make test:smoke` | Smoke subset |

## Conventions

- Tests live under `apps/api/tests/` with `test_*.py` modules.
- Async tests use `pytest-asyncio` (mode auto in `pyproject.toml`).
- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` + `ASGITransport` for API tests against `main.app`.
- Prefer explicit fixtures in `conftest.py` for shared clients and DB setup.

## Coverage

Coverage is enforced in CI (`--cov-fail-under` in `pyproject.toml`). Add tests for any new behavior or bug fix.
