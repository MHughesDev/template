# 3.0 — Development overview

<!-- CROSS-REFERENCES -->
<!-- - Referenced by: docs/development/README.md, README.md -->

**Purpose:** Index of developer documentation: setup, workflow, testing, and standards.

## 3.0.1 Overview

Index of developer documentation: setup, workflow, testing, and standards. See [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for validation commands.

**Agents:** Queue and validation commands are documented in **[local-setup.md](local-setup.md)** (section *Agent and queue tooling*). Shared queue CSV logic lives in **`packages/queue_ops`** (not a separate MCP binary).
