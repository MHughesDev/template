**Purpose:** How to identify, isolate, and fix flaky tests: detection, quarantine, root cause analysis.

## Purpose

How to identify, isolate, and fix flaky tests: detection, quarantine, root cause analysis.

## When to Invoke

- You are adding or changing async tests, HTTP client tests, or pytest-asyncio configuration.
- You are implementing or testing a change that matches the summary above.
- You need a checklist before merging or handing off work in this area.

## Prerequisites

- Read root `AGENTS.md` and complete the mandatory skill search (`make skills-list` or `skills/README.md`).
- Install dev dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` (or use `./setup.sh`).
- `make test` runs clean locally before you push.

## Relevant Files/Areas

- This skill file and `skills/README.md`
- `docs/procedures/implement-change.md` and `docs/procedures/validate-change.md`
- `apps/api/tests/`
- `pyproject.toml` (pytest / asyncio)
- `docs/quality/testing-strategy.md`

## Step-by-Step Method

1. Read the **Purpose** and **When to Invoke** sections above — confirm this skill applies.
2. Inspect the code and docs listed under **Relevant Files/Areas**.
3. Apply the change in small commits; keep scope aligned with `AGENTS.md` §6.
4. Run `make lint`, `make fmt`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` (add focused pytest if needed).
5. Update user-facing or operator docs if behavior changed.

## Command Examples

- `make lint` — Ruff
- `make fmt` — format check
- `make typecheck` — mypy
- `make test` — full suite
- `pytest apps/api/tests/ -q` — focused run

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Change matches the skill summary and acceptance criteria for the task
- [ ] `make lint`, `make fmt`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` pass
- [ ] Docs or queue notes updated if required by the change

## Common Failure Modes

- **Scope creep**: fix unrelated issues in the same PR — split work per `AGENTS.md` §6.
- **Skipping validation**: run the full `make` checks above before handoff.

## Handoff Expectations

- List files changed, commands run with key output, risks, and follow-ups (see `skills/agent-ops/implementation-handoff.md`).
