> PURPOSE: [FULL SKILL] How to run and interpret the comprehensive repo self-audit. Verifies spec compliance: required files exist, skills have all sections, prompts have front matter, procedures have required fields, queue schema valid, Make targets documented, file title comments present. Per spec §26.4 item 47.

## Purpose

> CONTENT: One paragraph. The repo self-audit is the periodic health check that verifies the repository machine is spec-compliant. It catches drift between the spec and the implementation before it becomes a problem. Running `make audit:self` is mandatory before any major PR and should be run on a weekly/monthly cadence.

## When to Invoke

> CONTENT:
> - Before opening any substantial PR
> - After a major implementation phase
> - On weekly/monthly audit cadence (document in queue)
> - When investigating "the repo feels off" — drift symptoms

## Prerequisites

> CONTENT:
> - Python 3.12+ with virtual environment activated
> - `queue/queue.csv` and `queue/queuearchive.csv` exist
> - `spec/spec.md` accessible (for inventory reference)

## Relevant Files/Areas

> CONTENT:
> - `scripts/audit-self.sh` — the shell script that orchestrates the audit
> - `skills/agent-ops/repo-self-audit.py` — the Python audit engine
> - `spec/spec.md` §26 — the required file inventory
> - `.cursor/rules/global.md` — file title comment standard (§1.7)

## Step-by-Step Method

> CONTENT: Numbered steps:
> 1. Run `make audit:self` (which calls `scripts/audit-self.sh`)
> 2. Review the output sections:
>    - **INVENTORY**: missing required files
>    - **TITLE COMMENTS**: files missing §1.7 title comment
>    - **SKILL FORMAT**: skills missing §6.2 required sections
>    - **PROMPT METADATA**: prompts missing §7.2 front matter fields
>    - **PROCEDURE STRUCTURE**: procedures missing §8.3 required sections
>    - **QUEUE SCHEMA**: queue.csv/archive.csv header problems
>    - **MAKE TARGETS**: §10.2 required targets missing from Makefile
> 3. Categorize findings: BLOCKING (required file missing) vs WARNING (format issue)
> 4. For BLOCKING: create queue items or fix immediately
> 5. For WARNING: create queue items for later remediation
> 6. Paste the "AUDIT SUMMARY" section in PR description as evidence

## Command Examples

> CONTENT:
> - `make audit:self` — run full audit (primary entry point)
> - `python skills/agent-ops/repo-self-audit.py --check inventory` — inventory only
> - `python skills/agent-ops/repo-self-audit.py --check queue` — queue schema only
> - `python skills/agent-ops/repo-self-audit.py --format json > audit.json` — machine-readable output

## Validation Checklist

> CONTENT:
> - [ ] All BLOCKING findings resolved before PR merge
> - [ ] All WARNING findings acknowledged (queued or documented)
> - [ ] Audit summary included in PR description
> - [ ] No new BLOCKING findings introduced by the current change

## Common Failure Modes

> CONTENT:
> - **Audit not run before PR**: findings discovered by human reviewer instead. Fix: `make audit:self` before any `git push`.
> - **Blocking findings ignored**: merging with known spec violations. Fix: treat BLOCKING as a CI blocker.
> - **Audit output not saved**: reviewer can't see what was checked. Fix: paste AUDIT SUMMARY in PR description.

## Handoff Expectations

> CONTENT: Include the full audit summary in the PR description. State: "Audit run: make audit:self — PASS/FAIL. [N] blocking, [N] warning findings."

## Machinery

> CONTENT: `skills/agent-ops/repo-self-audit.py` — automated audit engine that checks: file inventory (§26), skill format (§6.2), prompt metadata (§7.2), procedure structure (§8.3), queue schema, Make targets (§10.2), file title comments (§1.7). Produces structured Markdown report with BLOCKING/WARNING categorized findings. Invoke: `python skills/agent-ops/repo-self-audit.py` or `make audit:self`.
