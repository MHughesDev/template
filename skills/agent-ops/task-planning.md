> PURPOSE: [FULL SKILL] How to decompose a task into implementable steps with acceptance criteria, file impact analysis, risk identification, and scope bounds. Per spec §26.4 item 41.

## Purpose

> CONTENT: One paragraph. This skill produces an implementation plan document that is the contract between planning and implementation. A plan reduces implementation errors by explicitly stating: what must be true when done, which files will change, what risks exist, and what is explicitly out of scope.

## When to Invoke

> CONTENT:
> - Before beginning any implementation (mandatory)
> - After reading a queue item but before branching
> - When a task is discovered to be larger than expected (re-plan)
> - After a blocking issue is resolved and work resumes

## Prerequisites

> CONTENT:
> - Task description or queue item fully read
> - Mandatory skill search completed (AGENTS.md §13)
> - Relevant source files read
> - AGENTS.md §5 (Planning before coding) reviewed

## Relevant Files/Areas

> CONTENT:
> - The source files that will change
> - `apps/api/src/` — API source modules
> - `apps/api/tests/` — test files
> - `docs/procedures/plan-change.md` — the SOP this skill implements

## Step-by-Step Method

> CONTENT: Numbered steps:
> 1. Restate acceptance criteria VERBATIM from the queue item or task — do not paraphrase
> 2. Read the current implementation of every file in the affected area
> 3. List every file that must be created or modified (exhaustive — no surprises)
> 4. For each file: describe the specific change (add function X, modify class Y, add endpoint Z)
> 5. Identify risks: security (auth, tenant), data integrity (migration), API contract (breaking change), test coverage
> 6. For each risk: state the mitigation approach
> 7. Define explicit scope bounds: list 3-5 things this task explicitly does NOT do
> 8. Write the definition of done: what "complete" looks like verifiably
> 9. Break implementation into ordered, independently-committable steps
> 10. Estimate validation commands after each step
> 11. Write the plan in the format below

## Command Examples

> CONTENT:
> - `make queue:peek` — read top queue item
> - `make skills:list` — check for relevant skills
> - (No other commands — planning is a read+write-document activity)

## Validation Checklist

> CONTENT:
> - [ ] Acceptance criteria verbatim from task (no paraphrasing)
> - [ ] File list is exhaustive
> - [ ] Each file has a specific change description
> - [ ] Risks identified with mitigations
> - [ ] Scope bounds explicit (at least 3 non-goals listed)
> - [ ] Definition of done is concrete and verifiable
> - [ ] Steps are independently committable
> - [ ] Plan reviewed before implementation starts

## Common Failure Modes

> CONTENT:
> - **Vague acceptance criteria**: "implement the feature" — impossible to verify. Fix: always quote verbatim from the task summary.
> - **Missing files in list**: discovering unplanned files during implementation. Fix: read all related code before planning, not during.
> - **No scope bounds**: scope creep during implementation. Fix: explicitly list 3-5 non-goals.
> - **Missing risk**: discovering a security risk after implementation. Fix: always check security/tenancy risks explicitly.

## Handoff Expectations

> CONTENT: The plan document is handed to the implementation agent. It must be:
> - Stored in PR description draft or queue notes
> - Complete enough that a different agent could implement from it without clarification
> - Linked from the queue item notes when queue-driven
